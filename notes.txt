This is literally just a scratch pad for myself so I can think "out loud".

So I need Character definitions.

What is a tabletop rpg character defined by?
- Statistics
- Actions
- Notes (this is just extended text)

What should the data representation be?
  - Statistics is easy. It's just a number per thing. So a Map<string, number>
    solves that problem pretty directly.
  - Actions are a composite object. Actions are made up of other things.
    We should circle back to this one. I think this is the one we do first
    explicitly *because* it's the least atomic. We can break it down further.
  - Notes. A long string.
  - There could also be more, but most feats fall under notes because they're
    timing triggers or other somesuch modifiers. So they're the responsibility
    of the player or dungeon-master.

What are Actions made up of?
  - An action is anything a character can do as a declaration as part of the
    game rules.
  - Therefore an action is made up of multiple Rolls for resolving different
    pieces of the action
  - An action may also have other notes attached "on failure the target gets debuffed"
    There's not a great way to handle this either. Much like feats.
  - Actions might have different tags for additional properties.

So our next course of action is defining an Action
